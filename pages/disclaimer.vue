                Picasso provides a non-custodial software interface to trade on Injective Protocol, which is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that
                people can use to enter into decentralized perpetual swaps, futures, spot trades and trade on margin. The protocol is made up of free,
                public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on various blockchain networks,
                including, without limitation, the Ethereum and Injective blockchains. Your use of the Picasso relayer and Injective protocol involves
                various risks, including, but not limited to, risks inherent to cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks, [•], and losses due
                to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and other assets underlying derivatives contracts and swaps. Before using the Picasso, you should
                review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the Injective protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email
                protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the Injective protocol through a variety of web or mobile interfaces,
                Picasso being one of them. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on Picasso and Injective Protocol to understand the fees and risks present.
                Please read the terms and conditions provided on the Injective Protocol website (injectiveprotocol.com) before using Picasso exchange website.
