The protocol is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on various blockchain networks, including, without limitation, the Ethereum and Injective blockchains. Your use of the Picasso relayer and Injective protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, risks inherent to cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks, [•], and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and other assets underlying derivatives contracts and swaps. Before using the Picasso, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the Injective protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the Injective protocol through a variety of web or mobile interfaces, Picasso being one of them. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on Picasso and Injective Protocol to understand the fees and risks present. Please read the terms and conditions provided on the Injective Protocol website (injectiveprotocol.com) before using Picasso website. No developer or entity involved in creating the Picasso interface will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the Injective protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.

                arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount

                the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), an
                established alternative dispute resolution provider (&ldquo;ADR
                Provider&rdquo;) that offers arbitration as set forth in this
                section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall
                agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the
                ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration,
                including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or
                demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in
                conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules
                (&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;) governing the arbitration are

                shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims
                or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
                than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved
                through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option
                of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the
                total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars
                (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be
                determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in
                a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside
                outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree
                otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
                shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and
                place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered
                by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is
                greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to
                you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay
                you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear
                its own costs (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and
                disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an
                equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</span

                written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the

                statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a

                you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated
                with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
                parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
                motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
                shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
                any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The
                arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision

                award is based, including the calculation of any damages
                awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief
                on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
                have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
